# hello-world
My first github repository and my gateway to freedom!

I'm currently a slave to the wage as an IT Project Manager. I've played around with coding many times before and always enjoyed it. I'm now ready to commit!

This is my first step to a career in freelance coding. My goal is to work freelance, away from the constraints of a 9-5 office job! Commitment will be vital! Come on, you can do it!
